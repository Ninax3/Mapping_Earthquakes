# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview 
Using data via the USGS (US Geological Survey) API services, earthquake data from the last seven days was retrieved and presented in an interactive map showing -
1) Tectonic plate lines.
2) Earthquake location and magnitude with visual markers and an option to see major earthquakes of a magnititude of 4.5 or greater. 
3) Maps created with Mapbox tile layers: street, satellite and dark versions.
